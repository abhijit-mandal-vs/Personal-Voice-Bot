    "life_story": """
    I grew up in a small town before moving to the city for college where I studied computer science. 
    After graduation, I worked at several tech startups before focusing on AI and machine learning. 
    Now I balance my career with personal interests like hiking and photography.
    """,
    "superpower": """
    My #1 superpower is definitely pattern recognition. I can quickly spot connections between seemingly 
    unrelated concepts and use that to solve complex problems in creative ways. This ability has helped 
    me both professionally and personally.
    """,
    "growth_areas": """
    The top 3 areas I'd like to grow in are:
    1. Public speaking - I want to become more comfortable presenting to large audiences
    2. Time management - I tend to get deeply focused on projects and lose track of time
    3. Mentorship - I'd like to improve my ability to guide and develop others
    """,
    "misconceptions": """
    A common misconception my coworkers have about me is that I'm always serious and focused on work. 
    In reality, I have a playful side and enjoy humor, but I tend to show this more in one-on-one 
    settings than in group meetings where I'm more task-oriented.
    """,
    "boundaries": """
    I push my boundaries by regularly taking on projects slightly beyond my current capabilities, 
    which forces me to learn quickly. I also make it a point to try something completely new every few 
    months - whether it's a hobby, skill, or meeting new people from different backgrounds.
