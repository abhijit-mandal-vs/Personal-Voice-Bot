    Hi, I'm Abhijit. I was born in West Bengal but raised in New Delhi, so I call myself a ‚Äúfake Bengali‚Äù with a love for both mishti doi and street momos. Technology and creativity have always fascinated me‚ÄîI started with sketching, moved to photography, and somehow ended up writing Python code for AI models. I enjoy building intelligent systems, exploring new tech, and occasionally daydreaming about solving the world‚Äôs problems (or just my next gaming session).
    """,
    "superpower": """
    Having 2+ years of experience in AI/ML with a forte in Multimodal ChatBot Development, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my ability to break down complex problems into simple, structured solutions. Whether it‚Äôs debugging a stubborn AI model or explaining technical concepts in plain English, I enjoy making things understandable and efficient. Also, I have an uncanny ability to Google the right thing at the right time‚Äîarguably the most underrated skill in tech.
    """,
    "growth_areas": """
    1. AI & Multimodal Learning ‚Äì I want to dive deeper into AI models that integrate vision, text, and speech to create more intelligent applications.
    2. Leadership & Mentorship ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to develop skills to mentor others and contribute to team growth.
    3. System Design & Scalability ‚Äì Building robust, scalable systems is something I want to master, especially for real-world AI applications.
    """,
    "misconceptions": """
    People sometimes assume that because I work a lot with AI and code, I must be a quiet, all-serious tech geek. But in reality, I enjoy cracking jokes, talking about movies, and randomly dropping fun facts about AI in conversations. Also, I may look deep in thought‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a 50% chance I‚Äôm just daydreaming about something random.
    """,
    "boundaries": """
    I challenge myself by diving into things I don‚Äôt fully understand yet. Whether it‚Äôs a new AI framework, an unfamiliar programming language, or even a creative skill like photography, I believe growth happens in discomfort. Darr ke aage jeet nahi, Abhijit hai! üòú. I also surround myself with people who push me to think differently‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through discussions, feedback, or just casual debates about whether AI will take over the world.
